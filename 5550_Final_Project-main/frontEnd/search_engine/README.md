**Welcome to Seach Team! This is the final project submission for CIS5550(University of Pennsylvania).**
***Group Member: Yiqi Shi, Xinyue Zhang , Fred Qi.***

### Overall Introduction:
As the search engine emerges to be the gate of the ‘Information World’, it naturally becomes a prevalent technology in our daily life since the beginning of the 20th century . We, as computer science graduate students at University of Pennsylvania, would like to boldly take on this new challenge to build out this complicated system from scratch by taking the class CIS5550 at University of Pennsylvania. Despite constraints of time and resources inevitably exists for this project, we had been proactively working on a web search engine aiming at maintaining a basic functionality with multiple key technical components, including Crawler, Distributed Data analytics, PageRank, TF-IDF score, Inverted Index, Data Storage and frontend design, etc.

### Frontend Technology:
In this particular technical section, we had been designing the UI/UX components and the entire frontend targeting at satisfying the critical demands of users, including but not limited to multiple rendering, scrolling up and down the page, pagination, navigation and retrieving the key information. By walking through the journey of our frontend design, users can expect to search any arbitrary terms that they are curious about, scrolling up and down all the requery results returned seamlessly, jumping from one page to another, searching unlimited terms just under one page multiple times, getting to know some key information regarding one specific page, i.e, title, short description,etc.
