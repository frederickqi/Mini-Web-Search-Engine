### Overall Introduction:
As the search engine emerges to be the gate of the ‘Information World’, it naturally becomes a prevalent technology in our daily life since the beginning of the 20th century . We, as computer science graduate students at University of Pennsylvania, would like to boldly take on this new challenge to build out this complicated system from scratch by taking the class CIS5550 at University of Pennsylvania. Despite constraints of time and resources inevitably exists for this project, we had been proactively working on a web search engine aiming at maintaining a basic functionality with multiple key technical components, including Crawler, Distributed Data analytics, PageRank, TF-IDF score, Inverted Index, Data Storage frontend design and deployment on AWS EC2 etc.
